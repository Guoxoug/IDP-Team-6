Control architecture:
c++ on arduino
    basic conditional statements triggered by serial input
    functions that can be called that control the servos
    input from sensors as serial output (need to be digital)
Python on PC
    Controller here
    Does all the decision making (if it is even needed)
    Takes serial input and outputs byte-strings to arduino

Python program structure



Arduino Python interface
    Python takes arduino bytestring and is able to convert back to characters
    C++ to get char from byte need to convert using char()
    Better to declare a charstring to write into (no standard library for string in Arduino :(
    Arduino stores incoming bytes in buffer (64 byte size)
    Arduino discards new data if buffer is full
    Read data is stored into memory and removed from buffer
    Probably same deal on PC  side but none issue since buffer will be much larger

    bytes([0]) makes a byte that is converted to int 0  in the arduino

    serialEvent:
        function that is called when data is available in buffer
